### Configuration
You'll need to install a couple of packages to get the Learn4 theme to appear as in the offical doc.

#### Prism
Install Prism Hightlighter via the admin panel, and enable it. Set linenumbers and commandline to enabled.
Then, you can use the following in your code:
```
[`prism classes="language-bash command-line"] git push [`/prism]
```

You'll have to set a different class for different languages. You can find the list of supported classes [on their git](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-prism-highlight#languages-included).
